# Programming C++

I follow the book "Programming Principles and Practice Using C++" by Bjarne Stroustrup, 2009.

Instructions for Windows 10/11:
1. Download the latest version of GCC with Clang for Win64 here: [Winlibs](https://winlibs.com/).
2. Extract the archive to C drive and add the directory `C:\mingw64\bin` to the system variables Path.
3. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
4. Install C/C++ extension in Visual Studio Code for C++ support.
